TO FIX:
	lib_smb.rb
		should qwinsta be run in logged in users? tasklist should show the events

	guide.rb

	poet.rb
		figure out why the store_* methods format differently...
		Add method to auto append host?
			def print_good(text); puts "\e[1;32m[+]\e[0m #{work_unit[2].ljust(15)} - #{text}"; end

	menu.rb

	remotelogin.rb
		WMIC instead of winexe to prevent service installation
		Do we need to pass a hash back or just an array? How bout 2 arrays, one with remote login, one failed?
		create a text file per user with all hosts they have access for furture attacks

	create README.txt
		Required gems:
			netaddr
			ruby-nmap
		howto?
		install script?

	checkda.rb
		Run domain group enum in setup somehow, not repeatedly. 

	hashesworkstation.rb
		look into wmis
		switch to stand alone cache dump

	hashesdc.rb
		add in banner for # domain hashes dumped
		limit the IF EXISTS calls to one winexe, use && and two diff echoes

	utils.rb
		redo into smaller libs?


	smbexec.yml
		add stop on success/logon failure check


MODULES to create: (and get better names for the files)
	Hashdump
	Expliotation
		powershell alphanumeric
		netntlm downgrade + lnk drop
		unc injection
		exflitration detection
	Enumeration
		disk quota


Extended goals beyond initial rewrite
	Create custom SMB communication class, remove external binary dependancies
	test other services with creds (sharepoint? ssh? etc)
	Scanners for windows priv escalation (NOT exploit but bad permissions, misconfig services, etc)
	Check for cached credentails
	Persistence module (across x boxes)
	Alert/time based checker for user logins on devices with access (Or wce in listen mode?)
