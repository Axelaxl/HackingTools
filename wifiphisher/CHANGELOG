Wifiphisher v1.1 [2015-07-01]

The actual first release of the tool happened on Jan 5 2015. Bugs have been
tackled since then. I consider this a maintenance release (1.1) after the major
release (1.0) that happened back then.

o Fixed compatibility with systems defaulting to python3. [@jaseg]
o Fixed bug with undefined variable (#7). [@yasoob]
o Fixed concatenation error. [@HassenPy]
o Code cleaning. [@yasoob]
o Added connection-reset template. [@shelt]
o PEP8 fixes [@HassenPy]

o Fixed the bug with the empty password (#97). [@sophron]
o Code restructure. [@sophron]
o Catched exception when another process is listening to one of our ports. [@sophron]
o Output a message when hostapd cannot be installed. [@HassenPy]
